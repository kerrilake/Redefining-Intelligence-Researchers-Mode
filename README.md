### 🎯 The Perceive • Relate • Apply Framework

This revolutionary framework, developed by Kerri Lake, examines intelligence through three core dimensions:

1. **PERCEIVE**: How species perceive their world through sensory capabilities, quantum field sensitivity, and consciousness-based awareness
2. **RELATE**: How species relate to their world through social structures, ecological relationships, and interspecies connections
3. **APPLY**: How species apply their intelligence through problem-solving, adaptation, and ecosystem contributions

### 🚀 Enhanced Intelligence Dimensions

Beyond the core framework, the platform analyzes:

- **⏰ Temporal Intelligence**: Time perception, seasonal cycles, long-term pattern recognition
- **⚡ Energetic Intelligence**: Biofield interactions, electromagnetic sensitivity, quantum coherence
