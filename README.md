Species Intelligence Research Agent v24
Overview
The Species Intelligence Research Agent is a groundbreaking web application that redefines intelligence research through the Perceive/Relate/Apply framework. Instead of measuring intelligence by human standards, this tool explores the unique cognitive capacities of different life forms and visualizes their relationships through innovative triangular mapping.
🌟 Key Features
Multi-Species Intelligence Analysis
	•	Compare up to 5 life forms simultaneously (trees, octopuses, dolphins, humans, etc.)
	•	Dynamic species addition/removal with live interface updates
	•	Comprehensive intelligence metrics across three core dimensions
	•	Optional human baseline for familiar context
Triangular Intelligence Mapping
	•	Equilateral triangle visualization representing the Perceive/Relate/Apply framework
	•	Corner specializations: Pure Perceive (sensory), Pure Relate (communication), Pure Apply (strategic action)
	•	Spatial relationships: Distance indicates similarity, center shows balance
	•	Interactive visual elements: Species positioning, connection lines, gradient colors
