# 🧠 Redefining Intelligence: Species Consciousness Research

A revolutionary web application that explores consciousness across all species through the Perceive/Relate/Apply framework, challenging traditional hierarchical views of intelligence.

## 🌟 Project Overview

This application generates comprehensive, scientifically-grounded yet warmly accessible research reports on species intelligence, demonstrating that consciousness manifests in countless magnificent forms across the web of life.

### Live Application

## 🎯 Key Features

- **AI-Powered Research**: Utilizes Claude AI to generate rich, citation-filled insights about species consciousness
- **11 Intelligence Dimensions**: Explores Perceive, Relate, Apply, plus Temporal, Energetic, Collective, Adaptive, Quantum Biology, Human Learning, and Conservation aspects
- **Conversational Tone**: Presents complex research in an engaging, accessible way - like a "favorite professor sharing amazing discoveries"
- **Comprehensive PDFs**: Generates multi-page research reports suitable for academics, conservationists, and consciousness explorers
- **Beautiful UI**: Intuitive interface with species selection and real-time research generation

## 🔬 The Framework

Based on Kerri Lake's revolutionary intelligence framework that recognizes:
- Intelligence as the capacity to **relate to** information (not just solve problems)
- Consciousness as a relational phenomenon across all life
- Each species as an equal participant in Earth's intelligence network

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **API Integration**: Anthropic Claude API via Netlify Functions
- **PDF Generation**: jsPDF library
- **Hosting**: Netlify
- **Design**: Custom CSS with glassmorphism effects
