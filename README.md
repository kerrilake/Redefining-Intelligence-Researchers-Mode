# Species Intelligence Research Agent v24

## Overview

The Species Intelligence Research Agent is a groundbreaking web application that redefines intelligence research through the **Perceive/Relate/Apply framework**. Instead of measuring intelligence by human standards, this tool explores the unique cognitive capacities of different life forms and visualizes their relationships through innovative triangular mapping.

## üåü Key Features

### Multi-Species Intelligence Analysis
- **Compare up to 5 life forms** simultaneously (trees, octopuses, dolphins, humans, etc.)
- **Dynamic species addition/removal** with live interface updates
- **Comprehensive intelligence metrics** across three core dimensions
- **Optional human baseline** for familiar context

### Triangular Intelligence Mapping
- **Equilateral triangle visualization** representing the Perceive/Relate/Apply framework
- **Corner specializations**: Pure Perceive (sensory), Pure Relate (communication), Pure Apply (strategic action)
- **Spatial relationships**: Distance indicates similarity, center shows balance
- **Interactive visual elements**: Species positioning, connection lines, gradient colors

### Research Simulation
- **Quantum-enhanced analysis** of biological intelligence patterns
- **Simulated research process** with realistic progress indicators
- **Detailed species profiles** including quantum detection, communication patterns, and strategic behaviors
- **Comparative analysis** highlighting universal patterns and unique adaptations

## üß† The Intelligence Framework

### Perceive Capacity
- Sensory systems and environmental awareness
- Self-awareness indicators and boundary recognition
- Quantum detection in biological processes
- Holofractographic information processing

### Relate Capacity  
- Communication patterns and signaling methods
- Symbiotic relationships and ecological partnerships
- Quantum connections and non-local coordination
- Ecosystem role and community integration

### Apply Capacity
- Strategic non-response (knowing when NOT to act)
- Creative applications and problem-solving
- Timing wisdom and temporal coordination
- Coherence optimization and system balance

## üöÄ Technical Implementation

### Architecture
