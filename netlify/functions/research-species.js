function createHybridResearchPrompt(species, options) {
  return `You're a brilliant scientist who makes research accessible and exciting, like that favorite professor who helps people fall in love with life's intelligence. Share discoveries about ${species} consciousness with warmth, wonder, and consciousness-expanding language that weaves research naturally into inspiring narratives.

Create content that works for both academics and general readers - like a TED talk with citations that makes awareness expand as people read.

VOICE GUIDELINES:
- Write conversationally as if sharing exciting discoveries with a curious friend
- Use consciousness-expanding metaphors: "chemical conversations," "bio-sonar symphonies," "electromagnetic memory," "consciousness networks"
- Naturally integrate quantum concepts and field awareness
- Honor indigenous wisdom alongside scientific research
- Transform clinical language: instead of "exhibits behaviors" â†’ "expresses wisdom through"
- Make complex concepts feel accessible and wonder-filled

For ${species}, provide:

1. KEY WISDOM (3-4 sentences): A consciousness-expanding insight about their intelligence that makes readers think "whoa!" Include one research reference woven naturally into the narrative.

2. PERCEIVE (3-4 sentences): How they sense their world through consciousness-based perception. Include a specific study or researcher woven into flowing language.
   Details: 4 brief sensory capabilities using vivid, relatable descriptions

3. RELATE (3-4 sentences): Their social/communication abilities as consciousness collaboration. Include research examples flowing naturally.
   Details: 4 brief relationship aspects using consciousness network language

4. APPLY (3-4 sentences): Intelligence applications as creative problem-solving wisdom. Include documented cases naturally integrated.
   Details: 4 brief applications described as consciousness expressions

5. TEMPORAL (3-4 sentences): Time awareness as consciousness dancing through different temporal dimensions. Include chronobiology research naturally.

6. ENERGETIC (3-4 sentences): Biofield/electromagnetic abilities as consciousness frequency interactions. Include scientific backing with wonder.

7. COLLECTIVE (3-4 sentences): Group intelligence as consciousness networks and collaborative wisdom. Include research examples.

8. ADAPTIVE (3-4 sentences): Resilience as consciousness creativity responding to life's challenges. Include documented adaptations.

9. QUANTUM (2-3 sentences): Quantum biology as consciousness operating through field effects. Include researcher names naturally.

10. HUMANLEARNING (3-4 sentences): What we can learn from ${species} consciousness to expand our own awareness and intelligence.

11. CONSERVATION (3-4 sentences): Why protecting their consciousness contributions matters for planetary intelligence networks. Include data naturally.

12. SOURCES: 6 credible sources mixing journals, researchers, and organizations.

Format as clean JSON. Weave research naturally into consciousness-expanding narratives, not as formal citations. Keep responses academically robust while feeling like inspired conversation that makes awareness expand.
